# bikeTDD

A repo for Megs and Eds TDD practise. 

## The Kata

- You are the owner of a scooter hire company. 
- It is nationwide, with a fleet of ten thousand bikes and an expected two million customers.
- Each bike has an ID attached to it. Each customer has a unique ID name.
- Customers use a mobile app that interacts with a QR code on each bike. 
- The app tells the service when, where, and by whom the bike has been hired. 
- Once the bike is used and put back in a holder, the customer is charged. 
- The system know what bikes are where, with locations having an ID number too.
- The bikes cost £5 for the first hour and £2 per hour afterwards to hire.
- They have a maximum hire time of 5 hours. Failure to return a bike within 5 hours means a £25 charge.
- Failure to return a bike at all is a criminal charge, with fines a max of £10,000.
- The system should send an itemised bill to the customer once they have completed their hire. 
- All humans must obey...
